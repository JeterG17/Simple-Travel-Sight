    <h1> Why New York never sleep? </h1>
     <div> </div>
    <p> First and foremost we be outside!!! The activities are 
        just endless you can never run out of things to do.
        New Yorkers are charismatic individuals who create any type 
        of fun in depressing times. America runs on dunkin but 
        New york runs on starbucks coffee. We also got two wake up 
        calls called where one is YURR! & second is you HURD!

    <h1> Loud Music </h1>
    <p> New Yorkers are very celebrative 
        whereever you turn in the corners of the streets 
        neightbors will sit outside in front of their 
        buildings & have speakers out to jam to the hottest
        released tunes with families & neightbors </p>
